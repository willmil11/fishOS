# 🐟 FishOS 0.0.1

# What's this?
It's an os built from scratch, the only thing not built by me here is grub that i'm only using to boot.

# Why?
Why not?

# Version history
Notes: It works that's it. For now it boots and does something interesting, it's only gonna become an actual useful os over time.
